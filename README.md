# Usage
The Bash script BashDataManagement.sh aims at presenting the most useful Bash commands to manage genomics data and dataframes from different sources.
# Backgroud
Three unit provide genomics data and dataframes.
- The unit 1 is a bacteriological unit providing results of genome typing
- The unit 2 is a sequencing unit providing reads with expected depth of coverage
- The unit 3 is a bioinformatics unit measuring the depth of coverage and GC %
# Objectives
The objectives of the three units aims at answering the questions below.
- Is there a correlation between the expected and measures depth of coverage?
- Are there significance differences between GC% of genome types?
# Follow step per step the R script with RStudio
```
gedit BashDataManagement.sh
```
